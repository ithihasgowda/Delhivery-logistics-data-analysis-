"This project analyzes delivery performance data, highlighting key trends such as busiest corridors, order distribution, average distances, and delivery times. It provides actionable business insights and recommendations to optimize logistics, improve efficiency, and reduce freight costs."


📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. On-Time Delivery Rate (%) – % of orders delivered within promised time

2. Average Delivery Time (hrs/days) – Time taken per corridor/order

3. Average Distance per Delivery (km) – Typical delivery travel length

4. Cost per Delivery (₹/USD) – Freight expense per shipment

5. Order Volume by Corridor/State – Number of deliveries across regions

6. Failed/Delayed Delivery Rate (%) – Orders not meeting SLA

7. Customer Coverage (%) – % of serviceable areas reached

❓ Business Questions to Answer

Which corridors handle the highest order volumes?

What is the average distance and delivery time per corridor?

Which regions show higher costs and how can they be optimized?

Where are most delayed or failed deliveries happening?

How can we reduce freight charges while maintaining speed?

What are the top improvement areas for delivery efficiency?
